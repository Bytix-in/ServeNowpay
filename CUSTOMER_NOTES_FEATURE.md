# Customer Notes Feature Implementation

## Overview
This feature adds a "Special Instructions" field to the ordering process, allowing customers to add notes about their preferences (e.g., "less spicy", "no onions", "extra sauce"). These notes are saved to the database and displayed to restaurant managers and kitchen staff.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema
- **File**: `database_migrations/add_customer_note_to_orders.sql`
- **Change**: Added `customer_note` TEXT column to the `orders` table
- **Purpose**: Store customer's special instructions

### 2. Frontend - Customer Menu Page
- **File**: `src/app/[restaurant]/menu/page.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `note` field to `CustomerInfo` type
  - Added customer note textarea in checkout form
  - Updated order creation API call to include `customer_note`
  - Added character limit (500 chars) and helpful placeholder text

### 3. Backend - Order Creation API
- **File**: `src/app/api/create-payment/route.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `customer_note` parameter to request body
  - Updated order creation calls to include customer note
  - Handles both online and cash payment orders

### 4. Restaurant Orders Management
- **File**: `src/app/restaurant/orders/page.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `customer_note` to Order interface
  - Updated manual order creation form with note field
  - Updated all order creation flows to include customer notes

### 5. Order Details Modal
- **File**: `src/components/restaurant/OrderDetailsModal.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `customer_note` to OrderDetails interface
  - Added prominent display of customer notes with warning for kitchen staff
  - Styled with amber background to draw attention

## Database Migration

To apply the database changes, run the following SQL:

```sql
ALTER TABLE orders 
ADD COLUMN customer_note TEXT;

COMMENT ON COLUMN orders.customer_note IS 'Special instructions or notes from the customer about their order preferences';
```

## Features

### For Customers:
- Optional "Special Instructions" field during checkout
- 500 character limit with helpful placeholder text
- Works for both dine-in and online orders
- Clear labeling as optional to avoid confusion

### For Restaurant Staff:
- Customer notes prominently displayed in order details
- Warning message to ensure kitchen staff sees instructions
- Notes included in manual order creation
- Visible in both order list and detailed order view

## UI/UX Considerations

1. **Customer Side**:
   - Field is clearly marked as optional
   - Helpful placeholder text with examples
   - Character counter to prevent overly long notes
   - Positioned logically in the checkout flow

2. **Restaurant Side**:
   - Notes displayed with amber background for visibility
   - Warning message emphasizes importance for kitchen
   - Included in all order management interfaces
   - Easy to spot during order preparation

## Technical Notes

- Customer notes are stored as TEXT in the database (unlimited length)
- Frontend enforces 500 character limit for better UX
- Notes are optional and can be null/empty
- Backward compatible - existing orders without notes work normally
- Notes are included in all order creation flows (online, cash, manual)
